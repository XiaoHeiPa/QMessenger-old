/**
 * A coroutine-based STOMP session. This interface defines interactions with a STOMP server.
 *
 * ### Suspension & Receipts
 *
 * The STOMP protocol supports RECEIPT frames, allowing the client to know when the server has received a frame.
 * This only happens if a receipt header is set on the client frame.
 *
 * If [auto-receipt][StompConfig.autoReceipt] is enabled, a `receipt` header is automatically generated and added to
 * all client frames supporting the mechanism, and for which a `receipt` header is not already present.
 * If auto-receipt is not enabled, a receipt header may still be provided manually in the parameters of some overloads.
 *
 * When a receipt header is present (automatically added or manually provided), the method that is used to send the
 * frame suspends until the corresponding RECEIPT frame is received from the server.
 * If no RECEIPT frame is received from the server in the configured [time limit][StompConfig.receiptTimeout],
 * a [LostReceiptException] is thrown.
 *
 * If no receipt is provided and auto-receipt is disabled, the method used to send the frame doesn't wait for a
 * RECEIPT frame and never throws [LostReceiptException].
 * Instead, it returns immediately after the underlying web socket implementation is done sending the frame.
 *
 * ### Subscriptions
 *
 * The [subscribe] overloads are a bit unconventional because they are suspending and yet they return a [Flow].
 *
 * They make use of the suspension mechanism to allow callers to wait for the subscription to actually happen.
 * This can only be guaranteed when making use of the receipts mechanism (please see the previous section).
 * All [subscribe] overloads send a SUBSCRIBE frame immediately, and suspend until the corresponding RECEIPT frame is
 * received (when applicable) or when the SUBSCRIBE frame is sent (when the receipt mechanism is not used).
 *
 * The returned [Flow] is the flow of messages that are received as part of the subscription.
 * This flow automatically unsubscribes by sending an UNSUBSCRIBE frame in the following situations:
 *
 * - the flow collector's job is cancelled
 * - the flow collector's code throws an exception
 * - the flow's consumer uses a terminal operator that ends the flow early, such as [first][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.first]
 *
 * Because of this automatic unsubscription, the returned flow can only be collected once.
 * Multiple collections of the returned flow (parallel or sequential) result in an unspecified behaviour.
 *
 * If an error occurs upstream (e.g. STOMP ERROR frame or unexpected web socket closure), then all subscription flow
 * collectors throw the relevant exception, but no UNSUBSCRIBE frame is sent (because the connection is failed).
 *
 * Various extension functions are available to subscribe to a destination with predefined message conversions.
 * You can also apply your own operators on the returned flows to convert/handle message frames.
 *
 * ### Heart beats
 *
 * When configured, heart beats can be used as a keep-alive to detect if the connection is lost.
 * The [StompConfig.heartBeat] property should be used to configure heart beats in the [StompClient].
 *
 * Sending heart beats is automatically handled by StompSession implementations.
 * If expected heart beats are not received in time, a [MissingHeartBeatException] is thrown and fails active
 * subscriptions.

     * - If no `content-length` header is provided and [autoContentLength][StompConfig.autoContentLength] is enabled,
